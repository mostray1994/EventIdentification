# EventIdentification
use twitter data to build a ensemble cluster system

•	Developed a Cluster which can deal with large-scale data and efficient with new incoming data in to cluster photos posted in Twitter by different event.
•	Calculated tf-idf for each textual attribute, then calculated the similarity of each records based on post-time, post-location and tf-idf vectors of textual attributes. 
•	Utilized one-pass-cluster for every single attribute and used the thresholds to apply an ensemble method.
